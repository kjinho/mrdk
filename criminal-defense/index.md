Our criminal justice system consolidates power in the hands of law enforcement and prosecutors. **Empower yourself** with the right attorney.

Attorney Jin-Ho King has experience in all stages of criminal litigation and in both state and federal forums. For example, Mr. King has helped clients by doing the following and more:

* negotiating pre-charge dispositions;
* defending cases at clerk-magistrate's hearings;
* fighting for the discovery of private, privileged, or otherwise confidential information from the government;
* independently investigating claims of innocence or wrongdoing;
* fighting to exclude illegally seized or prejudicial evidence;
* petitioning for immediate appeal of incorrect rulings;
* presenting evidence of affirmative defenses like self-defense and defense of others;
* trying cases to jury and judge;
* challenging convictions on appeal to panels of judges;
* petitioning for relief from judgment in the trial courts.


In any criminal investigation or prosecution, the deck is stacked against you. Even the odds with trustworthy and capable counsel.
